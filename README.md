# Predator-Prey simulator
## What is this?
Predator-Prey simulator is a 3D simulator of predators and prey interacting. The simulation takes place in an enclosed 
rectangular field, with actors located on multiple layers. A visual representation of the simulation is provided by a 
2D view of the field.
